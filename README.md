# Upload Field to YouTube for ACF (WordPress Plugin)

__Upload Field to YouTube for ACF__ is a WordPress plugin that allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube via API from the WordPress admin area and/or select existing videos on your YouTube channel based on playlists. It is particularly useful for managing videos that may be associated with Custom Post Types (CPT).

To use this plugin, you need to configure Google oAuth credentials so the plugin can authenticate with the user's YouTube channel.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.0
- WordPress ^5.7 || ^6.0
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) ^5.9 || ^6.0

## Features

- direct video upload to YouTube from CPTs within the WordPress interface
- selection of existing YouTube videos, filtered by playlists
- support for "unlisted" video privacy, making this plugin ideal for managing private or exclusive videos tied to specific content
- use official [ACF Example Field Type](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf-example-field-type)
- support for logging with [Wonolog](https://github.com/inpsyde/Wonolog) ^2.x, if available
- made with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com) (no jQuery)
- autoload classes with Composer and PSR-4
- support ACF nested repeater
- translations managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/upload-field-to-youtube-for-acf)

## Configuration

Once installed:

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to the `Plugins` section and click `Activate Plugin`.
2. Create a new field via ACF and select the `YouTube Uploader` type.
3. Read the description above for advanced usage instructions.

### Creating the oAuth Credentials

1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the **OAuth consent screen** section and configure the required details to enable authentication.
4. Then, go to **Credentials** and create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
5. In the **Authorized redirect URIs** field, enter your WordPress site's callback URL (e.g., `https://domain.tld/wp-admin/`).
6. Obtain the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

#### Limitations

If you use the API upload mode, please note this important notice [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/insert):

> All videos uploaded via the `videos.insert` endpoint from unverified API projects created after July 28, 2020, will be restricted to private viewing mode. To lift this restriction, each API project must undergo an audit to verify compliance with the YouTube Terms of Service.

### Setting in wp-config.php

Add the following lines to `wp-config.php` to define the oAuth credentials:

```php
define('FRUGAN_UFTYFACF_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID', 'Client ID');
define('FRUGAN_UFTYFACF_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET', 'Client Secret');
```

### Enabling Cache Busting

If you use filename-based cache busting, the plugin supports the following definition in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('FRUGAN_UFTYFACF_CACHE_BUSTING_ENABLED', true);
```

For more information, see filename-based cache busting on [Nginx](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx/blob/main/h5bp/location/web_performance_filename-based_cache_busting.conf) and [Apache](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/main/h5bp/web_performance/filename-based_cache_busting.conf).
